MVVM Light is a popular, 3rd party framework based on the [Model-View-ViewModel pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel)  by Laurent Bugnion. The MVVM Light Toolkit helps you toÂ separate your View from your ModelÂ which creates applications that areÂ cleaner and easier to maintain and extend. It also createsÂ testable applicationsÂ and allows you to have a much thinner user interface layer (which is more difficult to test automatically).

This toolkit puts a special emphasis on theÂ "blend ability"Â of the created application (i.e. the ability to open andÂ edit the user interface into Blend), including the creation of design-time data to enable the Blend users to "see something" when they work with data controls.
